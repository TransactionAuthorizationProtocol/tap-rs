# Future API Components

This document outlines API components that are planned for future implementation or are currently in development. As these components are implemented, separate dedicated API reference documents will be created for each.

## Planned API Components

### TAP Server

The `tap-server` crate will provide a full-featured HTTP server for TAP message exchange with the following features:

- RESTful API endpoints for message submission and retrieval
- WebSocket support for real-time message notifications
- Integration with identity providers for authentication
- Rate limiting and security features
- Metrics and monitoring capabilities

### TAP Client

A dedicated TAP client implementation is planned with the following features:

- Simplified API for sending and receiving TAP messages
- Connection management for multiple TAP servers
- Automatic message encryption and decryption
- Retry logic and error handling
- Event-based architecture for message processing

### TAP Database

A database abstraction layer for TAP nodes with support for:

- Message persistence
- Query capabilities for message retrieval
- Support for multiple database backends (SQL, NoSQL)
- Migration tools for schema changes
- Backup and restore functionality

### TAP Key Management

An advanced key management system for TAP agents with:

- Secure key generation and storage
- Key rotation capabilities
- Hardware security module (HSM) integration
- Multi-signature support
- Key recovery mechanisms

### TAP Policy Engine

A rule-based policy engine for TAP messages with:

- Configurable validation rules
- Support for compliance requirements
- Auditing and logging capabilities
- Integration with external rule engines
- Extensible rule definitions

## Implementation Timeline

The following is the tentative timeline for implementing these components:

1. TAP Server - Q3 2023
2. TAP Client - Q4 2023
3. TAP Database - Q1 2024
4. TAP Key Management - Q2 2024
5. TAP Policy Engine - Q3 2024

As each component is implemented, this document will be updated with links to the dedicated API reference.
