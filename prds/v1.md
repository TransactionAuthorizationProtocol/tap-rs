# Rust TAP Implementation PRD and Best Practices

This document outlines the product requirements for a Rust implementation of the Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP), targeting payment-related use cases and Travel Rule messaging. The project is structured as a Rust workspace with multiple crates. Each item below is represented as a checklist (using markdown checkboxes) to track progress. Additionally, best practices for Rust development and references/URLs to useful specifications are provided at each step.

## Project Requirements

### tap-core (TAP Core Message Processing)
- [ ] **DIDComm Integration:**  
  - Integrate with a Rust DIDComm v2 library (e.g. [didcomm](https://crates.io/crates/didcomm)).  
  - Allow vendor/forking if needed for WASM support.  
  - **Reference:** [DIDComm Messaging Spec](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/)
- [ ] **TAP Message Structs:**  
  - Define Rust structs/enums for all TAP message types (transaction proposal, identity exchange, Travel Rule info, authorization response, error/NACK).  
  - **Reference:** [TAP Spec](https://tap.rsvp) and [TAIPs Repository](https://github.com/TransactionAuthorizationProtocol/TAIPs)
- [ ] **Message Parsing:**  
  - Convert incoming DIDComm messages (plaintext after decryption) into corresponding TAP message structs and validate required fields.
- [ ] **Message Construction:**  
  - Create outgoing DIDComm messages by serializing TAP structs into JSON and encrypting/signing them as needed.
- [ ] **Security (Integrity & Privacy):**  
  - Support authcrypt and anoncrypt mechanisms; verify signatures on incoming messages.
- [ ] **WASM Compatibility:**  
  - Ensure all cryptographic dependencies are WASM-friendly and the crate compiles for the `wasm32` target.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Optimize parsing and message packing for high throughput (aim for thousands of messages per second).
- [ ] **Extensibility:**  
  - Structure message handling to easily allow new TAP message types or protocol versions.
- [ ] **Unit Tests:**  
  - Develop tests for each message type conversion and validation.
- [ ] **Fuzz Testing:**  
  - Implement fuzz tests for message parsing against malformed or malicious inputs.

  - Write tests for signing, decryption, and message verification.
- [ ] **Integration Tests:**  
  - Test end-to-end scenarios with tap-core (e.g. an agent signing a message that another verifies).
- [ ] **Fuzz/Robustness Tests:**  
  - Fuzz input parsers for DIDs and DID documents for stability against malformed data.

## Rust Development Best Practices

- **Code Formatting:**  
  - Use `rust fmt` to ensure code is consistently formatted.  
  - **Reference:** [Rustfmt GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- **Linting:**  
  - Utilize `clippy` for catching common mistakes and enforcing idiomatic Rust patterns.  
  - **Reference:** [Clippy Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/)
- **Testing:**  
  - Write unit tests, integration tests, and fuzz tests for all critical modules.  
  - Use `cargo test` for automated testing.
- **Documentation:**  
  - Document public APIs using Rust doc comments and generate documentation with `cargo doc`.
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Use `Result` and proper error types. Consider libraries like [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) for easier error management.
- **Dependency Management:**  
  - Manage dependencies via Cargo; prefer libraries that are actively maintained and WASM-friendly.
- **Async Programming:**  
  - Leverage the Tokio runtime for asynchronous operations and consider using async/await for readability.
- **Security:**  
  - Use vetted cryptographic libraries and review security practices for key management (especially for signing and encryption operations).
- **Modularity & Extensibility:**  
  - Design components as small, testable units; use traits and generics to allow future extensions.
- **Performance:**  
  - Profile performance, especially for high-throughput scenarios. Use benchmarks and tools like `cargo bench`.
