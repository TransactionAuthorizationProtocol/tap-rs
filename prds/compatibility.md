## Issues That Need To Be Fixed In Our Implementation

- [x] **Presentation Message Protocol Support**: Enhanced our implementation to support the DIDComm present-proof protocol format used in the test vectors.
  
- [x] **Improve Validation Logic**: Updated our presentation validation logic to handle empty bodies with attachments properly.
  
- [x] **Missing Required Field Validation**: Enhanced our validator to properly check for missing fields in presentation and transfer messages.
  
- [x] **Unimplemented Message Types**:
  - [x] Confirm Relationship
  - [x] Policy Management
  - [x] Payment Request
  - [x] Connect
  - [x] Authorization Required
  - [x] Out-of-Band

- [x] **Newly Added Message Types from TAIP Update**:
  - [x] **PaymentRequest (TAIP-14)**: Implement message structure and validation for payment requests with both direct asset and fiat amount options. This includes handling different payment scenarios, such as direct asset transfers and fiat currency conversions, ensuring that the implementation can correctly process and validate these requests according to the TAIP-14 specification.
  - [x] **Connect (TAIP-15)**: Implement connection request message type for establishing relationships between agents. This involves designing and implementing the logic for connection establishment, including handling connection requests, responses, and potential errors, as outlined in TAIP-15.
  - [x] **AuthorizationRequired (TAIP-15)**: Implement message type for requesting interactive authorization. This requires developing the functionality to handle authorization requests, including user interaction for granting or denying access, and ensuring that the implementation aligns with the authorization flow specified in TAIP-15.
  - [x] **Out-of-Band**: Implement support for out-of-band messages referenced in the test vectors. This includes understanding the out-of-band protocol, implementing the necessary logic for sending and receiving out-of-band messages, and ensuring compatibility with existing test vectors.

- [x] **More Robust Date Parsing**: Improved timestamp parsing to handle additional date formats found in test vectors.
  
- [x] **Better Invalid Test Vector Detection**: Implemented proper handling of test vectors with `shouldPass: false` flag, especially for presentation messages.

## Issues In Test Vectors That Need To Be Reported

- [ ] **Timestamp Format Inconsistencies**:

| Test Vector | Issue | Specification Requirement |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| `transfer/misformatted-fields.json` | Simple date "2022-01-18" without time component | DIDComm v2 spec requires RFC 3339 format (ISO 8601 combined date-time) |
| `authorize/misformatted-fields.json` | Human-readable format "January 18, 2022" | Should be in RFC 3339 format |
| `reject/misformatted-fields.json` | Inconsistent timestamp format | Should be in RFC 3339 format with timezone offset |
| `add-agents/misformatted-fields.json` | Using integer timestamp `123456` instead of proper ISO format | Should use consistent format (either all ISO 8601 or all Unix timestamps) |
| `replace-agent/misformatted-fields.json` | Using integer timestamp `123456` | Should use consistent format |
| `remove-agent/misformatted-fields.json` | Using integer timestamp `123456` | Should use consistent format |

- [ ] **Message Type Format Inconsistencies**:

| Test Vector | Issue | Specification Requirement |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| `presentation/*.json` | Using `https://didcomm.org/present-proof/3.0/presentation` | Should clarify if TAP presentations should use this standard DIDComm protocol |
| `agent-management/multiple-agents.json` | Using non-standard message type `agent-management` | Should use standard TAP message types (`add-agents`, `remove-agent`, etc.) |
| Multiple files | Inconsistent use of camelCase vs kebab-case in message types | Should consistently use kebab-case per common convention |

- [ ] **Incorrect `should_pass` Values**:

| Test Vector | Issue | Recommended Fix |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| `presentation/missing-required-fields.json` | Missing fields but marked as `should_pass: true` | Should be marked as `should_pass: false` |
| Several misformatted test vectors | Explicitly designed to test error handling but set `should_pass: true` | Should be marked as `should_pass: false` |

- [ ] **Type Mismatches**:

| Test Vector | Issue | Specification Requirement |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| `authorize/misformatted-fields.json` | String "did:web:originator.vasp" where sequence expected | Should follow proper DID format as specified |
| `presentation/misformatted-fields.json` | Integer `12345` where string expected | Should use string for ID fields |
| Multiple misformatted files | Using integers for string IDs | IDs should be consistently typed as strings |

- [ ] **Schema Structure Issues**:

| Test Vector | Issue | Specification Requirement |
|-------------|-------|---------------------------|
| `caip-identifiers/invalid-asset-identifiers.json` | Missing `field` property | Test vector JSON structure should be consistent |
| `didcomm/json-format.json` | Missing `shouldPass` field | All test vectors should include this required field |
| `didcomm/test-vectors/didcomm/transfer-didcomm.json` | Missing `purpose` field | All test vectors should have a consistent structure |
| `didcomm/transfer-didcomm.json` | Missing `purpose` field | All test vectors should have a consistent structure |

- [ ] **Inconsistent Test Vector Structure**:

| Issue | Description | Recommendation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Inconsistent test naming | Similar test cases have different naming patterns | Standardize test naming for clarity (e.g., "minimal", "valid", "invalid-*") |
| Inconsistent directory structure | Some test vectors are nested more deeply than others | Establish a consistent directory hierarchy |
| Validation expectations | Some invalid message test vectors are marked `should_pass: true` | Ensure validation expectations match the test vector content |

## Important Discussion Points

- [ ] **Presentation Message Compatibility**: The presentation message test vectors use the DIDComm present-proof protocol format, while the TAP implementation expects a TAP-specific format. This requires clarification about whether TAP should:

  1. Adopt the standard DIDComm present-proof protocol for presentations
  2. Define a TAP-specific presentation format that extends the DIDComm protocol
  3. Support both formats for better interoperability

- [ ] **Integration with Standard DIDComm Protocols**: Beyond presentations, should TAP leverage existing DIDComm protocol types where possible, or should it maintain its own protocol types?

## Recommendations

1. **For Our Implementation**:
   - âœ… Improve validation logic for all message types
   - âœ… Implement the missing message types
   - âœ… Enhance date parsing capabilities
   - âœ… Add support for standard DIDComm present-proof protocol for presentation messages
   - Consider additional enhancements for misformatted fields tolerance

2. **For Test Vector Specification**:
   - Standardize timestamp formats across all test vectors
   - Ensure consistent message type naming (preferably kebab-case)
   - Fix incorrect `should_pass` values to match the test intent
   - Standardize test vector structure and directory organization
   - Define clear expectations for handling misformatted fields

## Current Compatibility Status

As of April 11, 2025, our implementation successfully validates most test vectors. The key improvements include:

1. âœ… Fixed the AssetId handling in the Transfer message to support both string and object representations
2. âœ… Ensured proper handling of optional fields (beneficiary, settlement_id, memo) during deserialization
3. âœ… Improved error handling throughout the codebase

The main remaining gap is in Presentation message handling, where our implementation now supports the standard DIDComm present-proof protocol format used in the test vectors.

   - Updating API documentation for all message types
   - Creating examples for each supported message type and format

2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize message parsing and validation for improved throughput, especially for applications that need to handle high volumes of TAP messages.
   - Profile the current implementation to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize attachment handling, which can be memory-intensive
   - Consider asynchronous processing for validation steps

3. **Continued Test Vector Improvement**:
   - Add more edge cases to the existing test vectors
   - Ensure all message types have comprehensive test coverage
   - Automate test vector validation as part of CI/CD
