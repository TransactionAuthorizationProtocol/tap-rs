# TAP-RS User Guide

## Overview

The **Transaction Authorization Protocol (TAP)** is a decentralized off-chain protocol that allows multiple participants in a blockchain transaction to identify each other and collaboratively authorize or reject the transaction *before* on-chain settlement. 

TAP adds an **authorization layer** on top of the blockchain's settlement layer, enabling counterparties (originators and beneficiaries, and their service providers) to coordinate safely and privately without modifying on-chain mechanisms. This approach helps solve real-world challenges like regulatory compliance and fraud prevention while preserving the trustless nature of blockchain transactions.

`tap-rs` is the Rust implementation of TAP, providing developers with a way to create TAP agents and process TAP messages programmatically. It implements the TAP messaging flows using **DIDComm v2** â€“ a secure messaging standard based on decentralized identifiers (DIDs). All TAP messages in `tap-rs` are DIDComm v2 compliant, meaning each message is a JSON envelope with standard fields (`id`, `type`, `from`, `to`, `body`, etc.) and can be cryptographically signed and encrypted as needed.

## Core Components

TAP-RS is organized as a workspace of Rust crates, each providing specific functionality:

- **tap-msg**: Core message types and processing
- **tap-agent**: Agent implementation with DID resolution and key management
- **tap-caip**: Chain Agnostic Identifier support (CAIP-2, CAIP-10, CAIP-19)
- **tap-node**: Node implementation for message routing
- **tap-http**: HTTP server for exposing a TAP agent endpoint
- **tap-wasm**: WebAssembly bindings for browser environments
- **tap-ts**: TypeScript wrapper for web developers

## Basic Usage Flow

The typical usage flow for TAP-RS involves:

1. **Setting up an Agent**: Creating a TAP agent with a DID and cryptographic keys
2. **Creating Messages**: Generating TAP messages like Transfer, Authorize, etc.
3. **Signing and Packing**: Cryptographically signing and optionally encrypting messages
4. **Sending**: Transmitting messages to counterparties (via HTTP or other transport)
5. **Receiving**: Processing incoming messages, verifying signatures
6. **Responding**: Generating appropriate response messages based on business logic

## Example: Transfer Authorization Flow

Here's a simplified example of how two parties might coordinate a transfer:

1. **Originator** creates a Transfer message describing the intended transaction
2. **Originator's Agent** signs and sends the Transfer to the Beneficiary's Agent
3. **Beneficiary's Agent** verifies and processes the Transfer 
4. **Beneficiary's Agent** creates an Authorize message if the transfer is acceptable
5. **Originator's Agent** receives the Authorize, verifies it is valid
6. **Originator** submits the transaction on-chain
7. **Originator's Agent** sends a Settle message with the transaction details

## Key Concepts

### Message Types

TAP-RS supports all standard TAP message types:

- **Transfer**: Initiates a transaction request
- **Authorize**: Approves a transaction
- **Reject**: Declines a transaction
- **Settle**: Confirms on-chain settlement
- **Cancel**: Cancels an in-progress transaction
- **Presentation**: Provides requested credentials
- **PaymentRequest**: Requests payment with specified details
- **Invoice**: Detailed invoice structure with line items

See [tap-messages.md](./tap-messages.md) for a complete list of message types.

### DIDComm Integration

TAP uses DIDComm v2 for secure messaging, with features including:

- **Signed Messages**: Digital signatures provide authenticity
- **Encrypted Messages**: End-to-end encryption for confidentiality
- **Message Threading**: Messages are linked through thread IDs
- **Transport Independence**: Messages can be sent via HTTP, WebSockets, etc.

### Chain Agnostic Identifiers

TAP uses Chain Agnostic Identifiers (CAIP) for blockchain references:

- **CAIP-2 Chain ID**: Identifies blockchain networks (e.g., `eip155:1` for Ethereum mainnet)
- **CAIP-10 Account ID**: Identifies blockchain accounts (e.g., `eip155:1:0x123...`)
- **CAIP-19 Asset ID**: Identifies blockchain assets (e.g., `eip155:1/erc20:0xA0b...`)

## Key Features

- **Security**: End-to-end encrypted and signed messages
- **Interoperability**: Support for multiple blockchains and assets
- **Extensibility**: Flexible message structure with metadata support
- **Compliance**: Travel Rule support with secure information exchange
- **Cross-Platform**: Native Rust and WebAssembly for browser environments
